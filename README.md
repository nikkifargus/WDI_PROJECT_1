<h1>Space Evader</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This was my first project for the WDI course at General Assembly in London. It was started at the end of week 2 of the course and completed by the end of week 3. </p>

<p>The game I decided to make was a rocket evasion game. Where the user controls a rocket to avoid hitting asteroids as they fall down the screen. </p>


<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>The given objectives of the project was to build an online game using HTML5, CSS3 and ES6 Javascript, incorporating the skills learnt in the first 2 weeks of the course. </p>

<p>As the scope of the project was relatively wide it was necessary to research what type of game I wanted to create and then decide my own objectives of how to acheive this.</p>

<p>So my chosen objectives were:<br>
<br>
1) Make a game with a slightly challenging logic problem for me.<br>
2) Make a simple game that is fun to play for the user<br>
3) Make a minimilist yet attractive design</p>

<h2>Planning</h2>
<p>The initial planning took place over 2 days were I had to decide what game I wanted to create, and then psuedocode in order to make sure I at least recognised the problems I would face. </p>

<p>The 3 main functionalities of the game that I identified were: <br>
<br>
1) Allow user to move the rocket (using either buttons/keys/mouse)<br>
2) Create and animate objects to fall down the screen which must be avoided<br>
3) Design the logic of the game so that if one of the falling objects hits the rocket then game over. </p>

<h2>Development</h2>
<p> The first step to creating my game was to develop a game area in which I could randomly generate objects to fall down. I created 10 columns which the objects could randomly be assigned to and animated the objects to fall from the top of the column to the bottom. I put this in an interval so that new objects could be created every 'x' seconds and gave a time for how fast the objects would go from the top to the bottom of the screen. </p>

<p> I then had to add the ability for users to move the rocket. I decided to use the arrow keys to move the rocket so this was done by added an event listener to the 


<h2>Future Improvements</h2>

<p>In the future I would like to add an ending to the game so that it is not just about getting to the highest level possible. My idea is that when a player reaches eg. level 3 then a home planet will appear at the top of the screen and the player must touch this with the rocket to win (whilst still avoiding the asteroids).</p>
